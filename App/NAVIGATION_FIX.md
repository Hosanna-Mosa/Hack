# Navigation Error Fix

## Problem

The app was showing the error:

```
ERROR Warning: Error: Attempted to navigate before mounting the Root Layout component. Ensure the Root Layout component is rendering a Slot, or other navigator on the first render.
```

## Root Cause

The AuthGuard component was trying to navigate immediately when the component mounted, before the Expo Router's Root Layout was fully initialized.

## Solution

Created a new `AuthWrapper` component that:

1. **Delays Navigation**: Uses a 500ms timeout to ensure the router is ready before attempting navigation
2. **Prevents Multiple Navigations**: Uses a `hasNavigated` state to ensure navigation only happens once
3. **Centralized Auth Logic**: Moved all authentication navigation logic to a single wrapper component
4. **Proper Loading States**: Shows loading screen while authentication is being checked

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `components/AuthWrapper.tsx`

- Handles authentication state and navigation timing
- Prevents navigation before router is ready
- Shows loading screen during auth checks

### 2. Updated `app/_layout.tsx`

- Wrapped the entire app with `AuthWrapper`
- Removed navigation logic from individual components

### 3. Simplified `app/index.tsx`

- Removed authentication logic and loading states
- Now purely a landing page component
- Navigation handled by AuthWrapper

### 4. Updated `components/AuthGuard.tsx`

- Added navigation ready state
- Improved timing for navigation calls
- Better error handling

## How It Works

1. **App Starts**: AuthWrapper shows loading screen
2. **Auth Check**: AuthContext checks for existing token
3. **Router Ready**: 500ms delay ensures router is mounted
4. **Navigation**: Based on auth state, navigates to appropriate screen
5. **Render**: Shows the correct screen (login, dashboard, etc.)

## Benefits

- ✅ **No More Navigation Errors**: Router is ready before navigation attempts
- ✅ **Better UX**: Proper loading states and smooth transitions
- ✅ **Centralized Logic**: All auth navigation in one place
- ✅ **Prevents Loops**: Navigation only happens once per auth state change
- ✅ **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support maintained

## Testing

The fix can be tested by:

1. Starting the app - should show loading screen briefly
2. If not authenticated - should show landing page
3. If authenticated - should redirect to dashboard
4. No navigation errors in console

## Files Modified

- `components/AuthWrapper.tsx` (new)
- `components/AuthGuard.tsx` (updated)
- `app/_layout.tsx` (updated)
- `app/index.tsx` (simplified)
